# German Sentence Inserter Bot

Hi there!

I created this bot to help me learn German more efficiently. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of adding complex German sentences to Anki for language learning. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what I did:

1. **Searched for Common German Words**:
   - I compiled a list of the top 1000 most common German words to serve as the basis for sentence generation.

2. **Generated Sentences**:
   - I used ChatGPT to generate diverse and complex sentences that include at least two words from the first 100 most common words. These sentences were then translated into English.

3. **Formatted Sentences**:
   - The generated sentences were converted into a dictionary format, with each German sentence paired with its English translation.

4. **Saved Sentences**:
   - I copied the dictionary of sentences and saved them into a `.txt` file for easy use.

5. **Automated Anki Upload**:
   - I developed a Python bot using Selenium that logs into my Anki account and uploads all the sentences from the `.txt` file into a designated deck.

6. **Result**:
   - The bot successfully logs into Anki and uploads the sentences. It works as intendedâ€”yay!

## Features

- **Automated Login**: Logs into your AnkiWeb account.
- **Sentence Insertion**: Automatically adds sentences to a specified Anki deck.
- **Customizable**: Easily update the `.txt` file with new sentences or change the deck name.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Selenium**: Install the Selenium package for web automation.
- **WebDriver**: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https:https://github.com/DomGoi/Portfolio-projects/Anki Uploader/main
   cd german-sentence-inserter-bot
