# Morse (De)coder

This is my first independently made PyCharm project, which I have further exported into a functional executable file.

## Description

This program allows any user to encode their own unique message into Morse code using international Morse code (letters, numbers, and special signs). Messages can be uploaded from a `.txt` file for both encoding and decoding functions. Additionally, the obtained message, either coded or decoded, can be saved in a desired file in `.txt` format.

## Features

- Encode text to Morse code.
- Decode Morse code to text.
- Upload messages from a `.txt` file for encoding or decoding.
- Save the encoded or decoded message to a `.txt` file.

## Installation
